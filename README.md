Clustering_Project
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values (Metascore, Gross) and standardized formats (Votes, Release Year).
- EDA: Histograms, scatterplots, heatmaps, pairplots, boxplots, and time trends give a thorough overview.
- Feature Engineering: Genre dummies and rating categories add depth.
- Clustering: KMeans applied with scaled features, plus interactive Plotly scatterplots.
- Visualization: Both static (Seaborn/Matplotlib) and interactive (Plotly) plots show versatility.
